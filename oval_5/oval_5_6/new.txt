New in Version 5.6
Version 5.6 of the Official OVAL Schema is a direct result of feedback from the OVAL Community. This will be a minor version change and may require some new development by tools that support earlier versions of the Language. The changes pending to the different schemas are outlined below. "Open" status means the item is under consideration or being worked upon, "Closed" status means that the item has been incorporated and work on it is completed, and "Suspended" status means that the item will not be included in this version but may be included in a future version.
